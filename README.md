# Going Rogue

An experiment building a Roguelike with libtcod and Python

`libtcod` is a library that provides a bunch of useful routines for building
Roguelikes. There are C++ and Python interfaces.

There are [Python docs][python-docs].

I also found a "make a Roguelike with `libtcod`" tutorial [on Rogue Basin][roguebasin-tut].
